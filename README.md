# UMBC-Advising-Registration

Project requirements entailed creating a basic web application that allowed users to enter their name, UMBC ID, major, and then select from all currently available advising times logged in a mySQL backend. Project is poorly designed in that it doesn't have user sign in for appointment logging or time changes, nor does it feature input validation or SQL injection attacks. Additionally it would greatly benefit from the use of AJAX opposed to php in order to have a singular static webpage and prevent unnecessary page loads/refreshes. Can be viewed at:

(Currently unstable due to UMBC pulling down old databases)
